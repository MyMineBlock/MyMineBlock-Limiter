Download Net Limiter and register with this: XLEVD-PNASB-6A3BD-Z72GJ-SPAH7

Make sure to have the NetLimiter Client closed in order to not get detected by Battleye!

This is pretty hard to mess up past that just don't suck

Hotkeys can now be changed without restarting the program!

In the future, expect a way to have mouse button hotkeys, as well as a consistent double damage glitch macro. (controller support?)

Very long term, maybe expect an undetectable driver that would result in potentially infinite damage glitches!
