# MyMineBlock-Limiter

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: 

YOU WILL GET BANNED IF YOU USE THE RELEASE VERSION
STEPS FOR AVOIDING DETECTION:

    DOWNLOAD SOURCE CODE
    ADD DLL REFERENCES INCLUDED IN THE RELEASE FOLDER (use the dlls from your netlimiter folder)
    RENAME NAMESPACES, EXE NAMES, AND WINDOW NAMES
    BUILD YOURSELF AND ENJOY(?)

Bans handed out are PC bans (all accounts on the PC get banned (PC reset required, no drive ban))
    This is inconsistent and seems to vary from person to person

Testing has been done, and the method above does work. Keep in mind that we will never know exactly what they are doing so enjoy at your own risk

Download Net Limiter and register with this: XLEVD-PNASB-6A3BD-Z72GJ-SPAH7

Make sure to have the NetLimiter Client closed in order to not get detected by Battleye!

This is pretty hard to mess up past that just don't suck

Hotkeys can now be changed without restarting the program!

In the future, expect a way to have mouse button hotkeys, as well as a consistent double damage glitch macro. (controller support?)

Very long term, maybe expect an undetectable driver that would result in potentially infinite damage glitches!
